# GANs Specialization

GANs Specialization made by deeplearning.ai (Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization)

This 3-course specialization is launched on September 30. The repository contains files for Course 1, 2, 3. The prefilled assignment files are already completed.


## Edits
Update 1: Made this repository public for reference (on September 30, 2020)

Update 2: Course 1 and 2 final materials added on (09/29/2020). Large sized files can be downloaded from Coursera.

Update 3: I have decided to only upload the ipynb files of the assignments as notebooks does not require any reference and the additional required files (dataset/utils.py etc) can be accessed from Coursera.

Update 4: Uploaded the files for Course 3 after launch on Coursera.


## Usage
Use the assignment files with prefilled code for reference only. I highly encourage you to solve the assignments on your own. In case you face any difficulties, the mentors of this specialization (me included) are available on [DeepLearning.AI GANs Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/deeplearningaigans/shared_invite/zt-hcngsgle-AiTpdD45jaT0IVOibkh9eQ). If the mentors are busy and you have less time, use this repository for reference to see what steps you were missing or doing wrong.
