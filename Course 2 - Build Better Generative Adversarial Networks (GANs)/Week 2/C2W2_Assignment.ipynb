    "### Goals\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to explore a way to identify some biases of a GAN using a classifier, in a way that's well-suited for attempting to make a model independent of an input. Note that not all biases are as obvious as the ones you will see here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1.  Be able to distinguish a few different kinds of bias in terms of demographic parity, equality of odds, and equality of opportunity (as proposed [here](http://m-mitchell.com/papers/Adversarial_Bias_Mitigation.pdf)).\n",
    "2. Be able to use a classifier to try and detect biases in a GAN."

    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "One major challenge in assessing bias in GANs is that you still want your generator to be able to generate examples of different values of a protected class—the class you would like to mitigate bias against. While a classifier can be optimized to have its output be independent of a protected class, a generator which generates faces should be able to generate examples of various protected class values. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you generate examples with various values of a protected class, you don’t want those examples to correspond to any properties that aren’t strictly a function of that protected class. This is made especially difficult since many protected classes (e.g. gender or ethnicity) are social constructs, and what properties count as “a function of that protected class” will vary depending on who you ask. It’s certainly a hard balance to strike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, a protected class is rarely used to condition a GAN explicitly, so it is often necessary to resort to somewhat post-hoc methods (e.g. using a classifier trained on relevant features, which might be biased itself). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn one approach to detect potential bias, by analyzing correlations in feature classifications on the generated images. "

However, currently there is no rigorous and accepted solution for debiasing GANs. A first step that you can take in the right direction comes before training the model: make sure that your dataset is inclusive and representative, and consider how you can mitigate the biases resulting from whatever data collection method you used—for example, getting a representative labelers for your task. \n",

Equipped with knowledge about bias, we trust that you will do better in the future datasets you create."
